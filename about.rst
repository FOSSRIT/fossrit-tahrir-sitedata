RIT Badges
===========

`RIT Badges <https://badges.rit.edu>`_ is a fun website built to recognize awesome FOSS work
done by folks at RIT.

How does Badges work?
---------------------

It's really easy! Just `sign in to Badges <https://badges.rit.edu/login>`_ with
your `Fedora account <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/>`_, and you'll
see you have at least one badge right away. Congratulations - you're a Badger!

Want to see how your badge collection compares with others? Check the
`Leaderboard <https://badges.rit.edu/leaderboard>`_. Jonesing for
more badges? You can check the `Badge index
<https://badges.rit.edu/explore/badges>`_ to see all the badges and
get to work on your collection! Click on a badge to see how to get it - but we
intentionally didn't spell it all out exactly. Part of the fun is figuring it
out!

Another cool thing: the Badges site is mobile-optimized, so you can easily keep
track of your badges on the go!

Can I submit new badge ideas and help build badges?
---------------------------------------------------

Yes! We'd love you to! For now, the best way to get involved
is to send an email to oddshocks@riseup.net. We'll have a better,
more public method available soon.

Can I help work on the technologies that underlie Badges?
---------------------------------------------------------

Absolutely! Please join us! Development of the software
that powers RIT Badges occurs in ``#fedora-apps`` on Freenode.
The folks who run this particular site hang in ``#rit-foss``.

- `tahrir`_ is the frontend you're looking at right now
- `tahrir-api`_ is the API for tahrir

Can I embed by badges in my blog?
---------------------------------

Our frontend app doesn't provide the tools directly, but we do allow you to
export your badges to Mozilla's `Open Badges Backpack`_ and *they* provide
`some tools for embedding your badges elsewhere
<https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges/wiki/Open-Badges-related-widgets>`_.

Click the *Export Badges* button on your profile, login via Mozilla's
"Persona" with your ``FASUSERNAME@fedoraproject.org`` email address, and
create custom badge displays there.
